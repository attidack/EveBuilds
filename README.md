Project Name: EVE Builder

EVE Builder is a React application that allows users to make better decisions on build cost vs buy cost by using data from EVE Online's ESI. With EVE Builder, users can easily check in-game inventory to see what they need to purchase, copy the items they need to a clipboard, and factor in invention and reactions to build price. Additionally, users can select a warehouse station and a market station and use images and icons from EVE Online and its API to get a feel similar to eveonline.com.
